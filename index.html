                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Python is a high level programming language with an emphasis in code readability.
                    Mostly used in back-end, its object oriented approach aims to help programmers write clear,
                    logical code for small and large-scale projects.
                </p>
                <p>It has a dynamic typing, which helps new Python Devs to write code without paying attention to
                    the variable's type. Also, it has strong typing, so any operation between variables with different types will
                    lead to an error.
                </p>
                <h3>Why learn Python?</h3>
                <p>Because its readability, strong typing, dynamic typing and simple syntax allows new learner to better understand it, unlike
                    other languages like C or Java. The algorithm implementation in Python is easier due to the little
                    attention a student has to pay in order to write code.
                </p>
                <h3>And why link it with Slytherin?</h3>
                <p>Nothing special. I am just fond of Harry Potter and I thought it would be a good idea to
                    explain Python with Harry Potter examples.
                </p>

                <h1>Basic Synthax</h1>
                <p>Python has a very simple synthax that allows us to better understand the code written. Since it is
                    a high level programming language, the reserved words are so close to the English language.
                </p>
                <p>It's not like speaking <em><span>parseltongue</span></em>: you can understand Python without having being related to any pythonmouth or
                    Slytherin developers.
                </p>
                <h3>Initializing and Declaring Variables</h3>
                <p>Unlike other programming languages, variables are declared and initialized using the <strong><em>assignment operator</em></strong> " = ":</p>
                <div class="code-div">
                    <code>
                        myHouse = 'Slytherin'
                    </code>
                    
                </div>
                <p>If you try to use an uninitialized variable, the code will print an error. That is why you always have to
                    initialize it first.
                </p>
                <h3>Indentation</h3>
                <p>In Python, we don't use bracket notation synthax to wrap a statement's block. Instead, what gives us the guideline for any statement's block
                    is the Indentation. That is, the space placed left to a code line. Because of that we can know which elements belongs to the parent, or which
                    elements are childs of its parent element.
                   
                </p>
                <div class="code-div">
                    <code>
                        slytherinMembers = 25 <br>
                        if x > 20: <br>
                            <span class="tab">print("There are so many Slytherins!")</span> <br>
                        else: <br>
                            <span class="tab">print("We should recruit more members...")</span> <br>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <h3>Operators</h3>
